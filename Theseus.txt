There is darkness inside me,
You cannot see it, 'coz it's hiding.
I have to find it, and kill it through,
but this time Theseus has forgotten clew.

He went through and couldn't comprehend,
Why there was only a mirror, at the very end.
He touched himself, made of piercing cold,
And he heard a voice, a voice that told:

The Minotaur hides within us and never dies
And those who believed it was gone, were deceived by their own lies.
He is the soul's labyrinth of every man,
And not even Theseus, was able to fight down himself.

When I learned the truth, my fear began to grow,
But there is no way home, from deep down below.
